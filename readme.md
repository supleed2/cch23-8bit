# Shuttle.rs Christmas Code Hunt 2023

This repository contains my [Shuttle](https://shuttle.rs/) project for the 2023 Christmas Code Hunt.

Handlers for each day is in the corresponding file in the [`cal` module](./src/cal/).

This project uses Axum and tries to stick with `std` as I'm trying to improve my Rust skills.
